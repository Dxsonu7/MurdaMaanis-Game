# MurdaMaanis-Game
1. MurdaMaanis is a command-line interface (CLI) game created using Java. 
2. Implemented the display of the game's state, looser based on number of invalid entries, and winner based on appropriate number of valid entries.
3. Used Java loops, conditionals, operators, methods, dictionaries to create the MurdaMaanis.

#About Game#: Inspired by Hangman game, Murda Maanis has special inclusion from v1.5! The game gives a chance to guess entire word after every guess that user makes. This option is enabled when  user it to two or more valid letter guesses!

#Note#: The game's .java file can be found in src folder along with the wordlist we will be using in the game.
          After importing the files on your computer, make sure you change your path to wordlistDX accordingly! :)
          
#FutureUpdate: v2.0 aims to include: the health bar or number of lives left, a choice to keep playing after a win or defeat, a choice for the user prompting if they want to play Guess-the-entire-word-round, and few more! :)
